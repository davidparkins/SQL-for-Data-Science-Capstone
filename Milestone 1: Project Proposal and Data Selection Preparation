                                                             Step 1: Preparing for your Proposal

1. Which client/dataset did you select and why?
  Answer: I chose the following client because I enjoy sports.
  
Client 3: SportsStats (Olympics Dataset - 120 years of data)
SportsStats is a sports analysis firm partnering with local news and elite personal trainers to provide “interesting” insights to help their partners.  Insights could be patterns/trends highlighting certain groups/events/countries, etc. for the purpose of developing a news story or discovering key health insights.

2. Describe the steps you took to import and clean the data.

  Answer: I imported the data into Databricks similarly to what was learned in "Distributed Computing with Spark SQL".
          I cleaned up the data by using DISTINCT on the ID column to eliminate duplicates and created a few tables to make the data easier to manage.
          
3. Perform initial exploration of data and provide some screenshots or display some stats of the data you are looking at.
  
  Answer: The first digging I did into the data was to see how many athletes won medals, and how many each one. I then grouped athletes by how many medals they won.
  
          SELECT count(name) as #_of_Athletes, 
                medals as Medals_won
          FROM profile
          group by medals
          order by medals desc
  
          The top 4 results of this returned:
            #_of_Ahletes     Medals_Won
                3               8
                8               7
                25              6
                57              5

   I also was curious about the breakdown of medals won by NOC
          
          SELECT NOC,
                 count(medal) as Medals
          FROM NOC_Medals
          GROUP BY NOC
          ORDER BY count(medal) desc
          
          The top 4 results of this returned:
            NOC               Medals
            USA                 5637
            URS                 2503
            GER                 2165
            GBR                 2068
            
4. Create an ERD or proposed ERD to show the relationships of the data you are exploring. 

          Genderinfo    <----     Profile    <----    Athlete_Events   ---->    Location  ---->     NOC_Medals
          -----------             -------             ---------------           ---------           ------------

          Sex,                    Sex,                 Sex,                      City,              Sport,
          Team,                   Height,              Age,                      Sport,             Season,
          Medals,                 Weight,              Height,                   Season,            Medal,
          NOC                     Age,                 Weight,                   Event,             Year

						       STEP 2:Develop Project Proposal

Description: I am going to look at marketing for sports brand companies. I am looking to break down marketable areas for successful sports all over the world. This will give companies the ability to market items directly to a consumer base that has seen success from Olympians, thus driving up interest. Ideally, this information will give a conclusive breakdown to which sport products and athlete likeness products will perform the best in which areas.

Questions:
		1. How many separate sports are listed? Will there be a dominate region for particular sports?
		2. How successful will small countries with few medals be and in which events?
		
		
Hypothesis:
		I believe countries like the USA will have a vast array of sports and athletes to market with, however, this could come with cost and more risk. I believe smaller countries will specialize in 1 or 2 events with far less 'Big Name' athletes and, thus, be easier and cheaper to pinpoint marketing efforts toward. I plan on providing data for both cases.
		
Approach:
		The approach I am going to take is to compare countries earned Medals to develop a heatmap of markets by event. I will use the Medals column with both Athletes and NOCs. The metric for evaluation will be medals won per athlete and medals won per NOC.
